# 💡 Project Idea: AI-Assisted Job Web Tracker

## 📌 Problem Statement

Job searching today is **manual, repetitive, and inefficient**, especially for freshers and early-career professionals.

Common problems:

* Checking multiple job portals every day
* Applying to irrelevant jobs
* No clear idea which jobs actually match your skills
* No proper tracking of applied jobs, interviews, or outcomes
* Resume not optimized for different job roles

As a result, candidates **waste time**, miss opportunities, and feel frustrated.

## 🎯 Solution Overview

The **AI-Assisted Job Web Tracker** is a smart web application that helps users:

* Find relevant jobs automatically
* Match jobs with their resume using AI
* Rank jobs based on skill relevance
* Track applications in one dashboard
* Improve resumes using AI suggestions

The system combines **rule-based filtering + AI-assisted matching**, keeping the user in full control.

## 🤖 Role of AI in the Project

AI is used as an **assistant**, not as a black box.

AI helps in:

* Parsing resumes to extract skills and experience
* Understanding job descriptions using NLP
* Calculating a match percentage between resume and job
* Suggesting missing skills or resume improvements

Final decisions (apply, ignore, track) are always made by the **user**.
